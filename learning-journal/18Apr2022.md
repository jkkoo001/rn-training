## What I Learned Today
1. [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15706480#overview): Videos #41 ~ #44<br />
   [React useState Hook](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usestate.asp) (w3schools)<br />
   - Props : pass data from parent to child
   - State : track a piece of data that will change over time and re-render the app when the data changes
   - Three questions:
     - What piece of data is changing in the app? (e.g. name from input)
     - What type of data is it? (e.g. string)
     - What is the data’s starting (default) value? (e.g. empty string)
   - `useState` (hook) : a function that adds some new functionality to a function component; accepts an initial state and returns two values (i.e. the current state, a function that updates that state)
   - Can create multiple state Hooks to track individual values OR use one state and include an object that holds all the values/properties
   - **Why use `useState`**: React does not automatically track changes on variable and re-render the content on the screen; with `useState`, it will watch the value of the variable and re-render the content on the screen whenever there is a change to the value of the variable
   - **Never directly modify a state variable** as React doesn’t directly detect this change, only use the ‘setter’ function
   - Can name the state variable anything
   - Can track changes on any type of data (e.g. array, string, number)
   - When a component re-renders, all children will be re-rendered as well

<br />
2. Challenge: apply CounterScreen to react-native-starter project
     <img width="350" alt="RNS Counter" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97433108/163765194-e61719ae-a06d-4f7e-8c50-e95254757d99.png"><br />
3. Modified CounterScreen in react-native-starter to include a second state which will increase/decrease the Count fontsize when the Increase/Decrease button is pressed<br />
4. Used spread operator to update only the specific property and prevent overwriting the original state object/array<br />

## Difficulties/Challenges/ToDo
1. Difficulty: tried to use useState to update the style property of the component but not sure how to apply, found a [suggested solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61407554/how-to-change-style-property-in-react-hooks-on-function-call) and managed to update the style through useState.

## What I Learned Today
1. [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15706480#overview): Videos #119 ~ #122<br />
   - Challenge #2: Business Search with Dynamic Location Search
     - reuse `SearchBar` component, change icon name to dynamic
     - create a reusable button component to be used as Search button
     - add `location` parameter to `searchApi`
       <br />
       <br />
       <img width="250" alt="Search Result with Location" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97433108/168069430-50899fac-c3c4-4ece-ab1c-0b90188c3c97.png">

2. Read up about Recoil
   - provides a global state so all components can share states easily
   - core concepts:
     - Atoms: units of the global state provided by Recoil, components can access and subscribe to changes made to them
     - Selectors: transform states either synchronously or asynchronously, and components can also access and subscribe to
   - Why use Recoil?
     - don't have to pass states as props down to children components in order to share them between components
     - once components are hooked up to any Atom or Selector, they are subscribed to it, so any update made to that piece of state will be reflected across the app to wherever itâ€™s being used
     - can transform a state synchronously or asynchronously and use the derived state anywhere in the app
     - minimal and requires no boilerplate code to get started

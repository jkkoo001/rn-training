## What I Learned Today
1. Object types: to group and pass around data; can be anonymous or named(using interface or type alias)
    - Property Modifiers: optional `?` and `readonly`(can be read/updated, cannot be re-assigned); can be removed/added using prefix `-` or  `+`
    - Extending types: using `extends` keyword; copy members from other named types, and add whatever new members we want; interface can extend from multiple types
    - Intersection types: using `&` operator; mainly used to combine existing object types
<br />

2. Class:
    - class properties can have initializers which will be used to infer the type
    - constructors: can add parameters with type annotations, default values and overloads; cannot have type parameters and return type annotations(the return is always the class instance type)
    - when extending from base class must call `super();` in constructor body in order to use `this.`
    - methods: function property on a class
    - can have accessors (getters & setters)
    - can implement interface/multiple interfaces using `implements`; parameter type from interface will not be inferred, optional property from interface will not be created
    - can extend from base class using `extends`; all properties/methods from base class will be inherited; can define additional members
    - member visibility: public(default visibility, can be accessed anywhere), protected(only visible to subclasses), private(not visible to subclass, TypeScript `private` is soft private - accessible by bracket [ ] notation, JavaScript `private` is hard private)
    - static methods/properties: cannot be called on instances of the class, called on the class itself; can use visibility modifiers; can be inherited
    - classes can be generic; `static` members of a generic class cannot reference class type parameters
    - `this` type: represents the subtype of the containing class or interface; each method in the class will be returning the instance of a class

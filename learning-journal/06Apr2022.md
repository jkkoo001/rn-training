## What I Learned Today
1. Narrowing
    - `typeof` type guard: checking against the value returned by `typeof`
    - truthiness narrowing: using any expression in conditionals, &&s, ||s, if statements, Boolean negations (!)
    - equality narrowing: using switch statements and equality checks like ===, !==, ==, and !=
    - `in` operator narrowing: determine if an object has a property with a name
    - `instanceof` narrowing: check whether or not a value is an “instance” of another value


2. Functions
    - arrow functions: the recommended type of functions to be used for most cases
    - using arrow functions with generic parameters will cause error during transpilation as the angle brackets are being confused with JSX element
      - workaround/solutions: use extends `<T extends unknown>`, add comma `<T,>` or use regular function


## Difficulties/Challenges Faced
1. I couldn't log my codes to the Metro terminal screen today, I restarted my laptop and `npm run ios` again but still faced the same problem, in the end found out that I have to click on/navigate to the Info screen on the iPhone simulator for the console log to be shown on terminal.

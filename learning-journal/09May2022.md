## What I Learned Today
1. [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15706480#overview): Videos #103 ~ #108<br />
   - Recap: Rules of Hooks
     - Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
       - Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
       - Always use Hooks at the top level of the React function, before any early returns
     - Only Call Hooks from React Functions
       - Call Hooks from React function components and not from regular JavaScript functions
       - Call Hooks from custom Hooks
       <br />
   - Custom Hook:
     - What? : a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks
     - Why? : to share logic between JavaScript functions
       <br />

       <br />
       - the `useLogin` hook is used in Detail and Setting Screens
       - `useFocusEffect` is similar to `useEffect` but only runs on initial render (if the screen is focused) as well as on subsequent renders if the dependencies have changed
       - wrap the effect in `useCallback` to avoid running the effect on every render if the screen is focused
       - `setTimeout` : execute a function after waiting a specific amount of time (navigate to Login page after 50ms)
       - `clearTimeout` : a cleanup function that runs when the previous effect needs to be cleaned up, i.e. when dependencies change and a new effect is scheduled and when the screen unmounts or blurs
     <br />
     
2. Challenge: Add a custom hook to add network status monitor to the react-native-starter project
   <br />

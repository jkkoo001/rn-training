## What I Learned Today
1. [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15706480#overview): Videos #135 ~ #150<br />
   - Change `useState` to `useReducer`
     - in BlogContext file, import `useReducer`
     - create `blogReducer` function above `BlogProvider`, pass in `(state, action)` arguments, set up the `switch` statement for different `action.type` (e.g. `add_blogpost`)
     - change `useState` to `useReducer`, pass in first argument which is the reducer function to use `blogReducer` and the second argument which is the initial state, an empty array `[]` (no blog post)
     - change second element in the array, `setBlogPosts` to `dispatch`
     - create `addBlogPost` helper function and pass in to `Provider` value
     - How it works:
       - when app is first rendered, there is no blog post because initial state is an empty array
       - any component trying to get info from `Provider` will be given the value defined in `Provider` (i.e. current list of blog posts and a callback function that will dispatch an action type `add_blogpost`)
       - when `add_blogpost` is called, `blogReducer` will run with the first argument, state (current list of blog posts) and second argument, action (type `add_blogpost`) and return a new state array with a new blog post
       - when `Reducer` returns some info, `Provider` will automatically re-renders and receives a new state variable (list of blog posts) from `Reducer`
       - `blogPosts` state now is an array with one object inside of it
       - the rest of the app will re-render and when Index Screen is re-rendered, it will receive the new value of `blogPosts` and render the new list of blog posts in its `FlatList`
     - `BlogContext` using `useReducer` with TypeScript
       - create `Action` type and add typing to `blogReducer`

   - Automating Context Creation
     - create a new file `createDataContext.tsx` under context folder (filename starts with lowercase because it will be exported as function)
     - import `React` and `useReducer`
     - export default () => {};
     - pass in the three arguments that need to be customised every time a context is created
       - `reducer` : the function that creates new data context
       - `actions` : object of helper functions with the dispatch actions to be performed by child component and update the state
       - `initialState` : the initial state when `useReducer` is called (e.g. empty array, empty object, number, string)
     - create `Context` object and `Provider` function using generic variable names so that they can be re-used by different components
     - remove `BlogContext` object and `Provider` from `BlogContext.tsx` and import `createDataContext`
     - refactor `addBlogPost` function in `BlogContext.tsx` to be called with `dispatch`
     - add `boundActions` to `createDataContext.tsx` and pass in to `Provider` value prop using spread operator `...`
     - update `BlogContext` in `IndexScreen.tsx` to `Context` and `BlogProvider` in `App.tsx` to `Provider`
   - Deleting Posts
     - add delete icon to `IndexScreen.tsx`
       - `npm install react-native-vector-icons --save`
       - add `UIAppFonts` to `info.plist`
       - `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
     - add `delete_blogpost` action type under blogReducer and `deleteBlogPost` dispatch action in `BlogContext.tsx`
   - Navigate to Show Screen
     - create `ShowScreen.tsx` under screens folder
     - use `useNavigation` in Index Screen to pass in second param (id) and use `route.params` in Show Screen to receive the param
   - Create Header button to navigate to Create Screen
     - use `navigation.setOptions` instead of `navigationOptions`
     - wrap in `useLayoutEffect`
     - reference: [Header buttons](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/header-buttons)

## What I Learned Today
1. [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15706480#overview): Videos #56 ~ #60<br />
    - useReducer (hook) :
      - When to use reducer:
        - Multiple pieces of state that are closely related
        - There is a set of precise, well-known ways to update the state values
      - A function that manages changes to an object
      - Gets called with two objects:
        - Argument #1: object with all the states in it
        - Argument #2: object that describes the update to be made
      - Caveats:
        - Never change Argument #1 directly
        - Must always return a value to be used as Argument #1
      - By convention, reducer function is defined above (outside) the component function
      - const reducer = (state, action) => {};
        - Community convention: action object contains { type: ‘xxx’, payload: y} where type is a string that describes the exact change operation we want to make and payload is some data that is critical to the change operation
    - Use either useState or Reducer to manage a set of state variables, not both
    - Apply Reducer to SquareScreen

<br />

2. Challenge: Apply SquareScreen with Reducer to react-native-starter and refactor
   - changed the action type to increase and decrease instead of colors
   - changed action payload to color instead of change value

## Difficulties/Challenges/ToDo
1. Difficulty: Not sure how to refactor reducer function to use different action type and payload, managed to refactor after reading some online resources.
2. ToDo: Go through useContext link from today's notes
